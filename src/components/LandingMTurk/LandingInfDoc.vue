        </h1>
        <p>This task requires two steps:</p>
        <p>Step 1: Evaluate the <strong>informativeness</strong> of a single sentence generated by a natural language generation system. The task should be possible to complete in less than <strong>3 minutes</strong>.</p>
        <hr/>
        There are two ways to determine that a sentence is informative:
        <blockquote>
            <strong>All important</strong> information is present in the summary
        </blockquote>
        Which in other words states that the summary cover all the important information of the document. However the summary itself might contains information that is not important. <br/>
        A short example where the highlights are important words:
        <blockquote>
        and
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Only important</strong> information is in the summary.
        </blockquote>
        Which in other words states that all information in the summary is important according to the document.
        A short example where the highlights are important words:
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Document</strong><br/>
            <a class="highlight">David Robert Joseph Beckham</a> is an <a class="highlight">English retired professional footballer</a> and current President of Inter Miami CF. He <a class="highlight">played for Manchester United, Preston North End, Real Madrid, Milan, LA Galaxy, Paris Saint-Germain and the England national team</a> (the rest is redacted)
            <strong>Summary A</strong><br />
            <a class="highlight">David Beckham, a retired English footballer, has played for 6 clubs and England national team</a> and is known for his crossing ability.<br/>
            <strong>Summary B</strong><br />
            <a class="highlight">David Beckham is a retired English footballer</a>
        </blockquote>
        All important information in document presents in Summary A, while only important information is in the Summary B.<br/>
        Alternatively, not all information in Summary A is important, while Summary B doesn't have all the important information from the document.
        <p>
        You will need to read a document (averagely 450 words) first in order to assess the informativeness of the summary.
        </p>
        <p>You will be scoring each sentence by stating how strongly you agree or disagree using a slider from scale 1 (strong disagreement) to 100 (strong agreement) based on how informative the sentence is to the reader (grammatically correct, natural sounding). All sentences are generated by summarising newswire articles and should not be upsetting to the reader.</p>

        <hr />
        <p><strong>Step 2: Sanity Check</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Please read the whole document before you do the highlighting</strong>. After you have submitted the evaluation, there will be one simple True/False question where we will verify whether you have read the document or not. Failure to answer the question correctly will invalidate the evaluation that the participant has done.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>There is a <strong>code</strong> that you have to copy and paste to Amazon platform at the end of the task. Only submissions that correctly answer the True/False question will be deemed as a valid HIT.</p>
